# Installation:

1. Place the `VTProp` folder from the download into `KSP/Gamedata`.
2. You no longer need to add `Liquidfuel.cfg` to use stock fuels. ModuleManager configs automatically set the fuel type.
3. If you want stock-scale engines, add `Rescale.cfg` to `KSP/GameData/VTProp`.

Firespitter.dll is required. AJE is also required.

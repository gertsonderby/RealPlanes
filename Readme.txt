Installation:
1. Place the "VTProp" folder from the download into "Gamedata".
2. You no longer need to add "Liquidfuel.cfg" to use stock fuels. ModuleManager configs automatically set the fuel type.
3. If you want stock-scale engines, add "Rescale.cfg" to GameData/VTProp

Firespitter.dll is required. AJE is also required.
